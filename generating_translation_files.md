## [](#header-2)Thanks for Giving a New Language to Moolticute!
We really appreciate you taking the time to translate the strings currently used on Moolticute.  
With your help, we can spread the Mooltipass eco-system to more open source enthusiasts!  

### [](#header-3)Prerequisites  
Translations are generated using <a href="https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/linguist-translators.html">QT Linguist</a>, included in the Qt environement.  
Instead of installing the complete ecosystem, you may simply download and execute the QT Linguist standalone installer <a href="https://github.com/lelegard/qtlinguist-installers/releases">here</a>.  

### [](#header-3)Working on Translation Files  
Head to our <a href="https://github.com/mooltipass/moolticute/tree/master/lang">Moolticute's lang folder</a>, download the file for the language you want to add, or simply use another file and rename it.  
Open QT Linguist that you just installed, open the file and click on each context and source text to write down your translations.  
You may view <a href="https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/linguist-translators.html">QT Linguist user manual here</a>
